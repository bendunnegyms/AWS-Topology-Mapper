  This readme will describe setting up the environment for now.
  
## Prerequisites
**npm** (node package manager) is the dependency/package manager you get out of the box when you install Node.js. I installed the react app with the latest version of Node. Node.js allows for javascript code to be executed outside of a browser.
**python 3.8.5** 

## Commands to execute
* To run the Django server:
	Run `source bin/activate`, or `activate` on windows in a console window opened inside *env* will enter the virtual environment with all dependencies pre-installed. 
	`cd serversidesrc` to navigate to the correct directory.
	`python manage.py runserver` to run the server as it is.
	The server will be running at **localhost:8000/wel**.
	
* To run the ReactJS App:
	`cd src` to navigate to the *src* directory.
	`npm start` will start the React server on **localhost:3000**.
